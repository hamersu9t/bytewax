# Errors

The dataflows in this folder are here to check, for any possible kind of error, that it is easy to pinpoint where the erorr occurred.

The `working.py` is the only dataflow that should correctly run. Don't mind if it does meaningless operations.

Running each dataflow you should be able to fix the error easily by reading the error message.
